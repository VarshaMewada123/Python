Introduction to Django:
Django is a high-level Python web framework that allows developers to build secure, scalable, and maintainable websites quickly.
It follows the MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture, which is similar to MVC.

✅ Django was created in 2005 by Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison.

⭐ Key Features of Django:
Feature	Description
🔄 MVT Architecture	Django uses MVT (Model-View-Template), which separates data, business logic, and UI.
⚙️ Built-in Admin Panel	Django automatically creates an admin interface to manage your data without extra coding.
🔐 Security	Django handles security issues like SQL injection, CSRF, XSS, etc., by default.
📦 ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)	Allows easy database operations using Python classes instead of SQL.
🧩 Scalability	Used by big websites like Instagram — can handle millions of users.
🔧 URL Routing	Clean and dynamic URLs can be created easily.
🧪 Testing Support	Django comes with built-in tools for testing your code.
📚 Well-documented	Django has extensive official documentation, perfect for beginners.
🌍 Internationalization	Supports multiple languages and regional formatting.
🔁 Reusable Apps	You can create modular apps that can be reused across projects.

MVT Architecture in Django
Django follows the MVT pattern, which stands for:

✅ Model
✅ View
✅ Template

It is similar to MVC (Model-View-Controller), but with a slight difference in naming.

🔸 1. Model
The Model represents the database structure.
It defines how data is stored using Python classes.
A Model is a Python class that represents a database table.
It defines the structure of your data — like columns in a table.
Django’s ORM (Object Relational Mapping) automatically translates this Python class into database commands.
You don’t write SQL directly; instead, you work with Python classes and objects.
Django uses ORM (Object Relational Mapping) to interact with the database.

🔸 2. View
The View contains the logic of your application.
It fetches data from the model and sends it to the template.
It handles HTTP requests and responses.
A View is a Python function or class that handles a web request and returns a web response.
It contains the logic of your application — like fetching data from the database, processing it, and deciding what to show to the user.
Views connect Models (data) and Templates 

🔸 3. Template
The Template is the HTML file shown to the user.
It displays data that comes from the View using Django’s template language.
A Template is an HTML file used to define the frontend (UI) of your Django web application.
It displays data sent by the view and helps generate the final HTML page shown to users.
Django uses its own Template Language (DTL) — it supports variables, loops, conditions, etc.

What is a URL in Django?
A URL in Django is a path that maps a web address (like /home/, /about/, /students/) to a view function or class.
It tells Django what to do when a user visits a specific URL in the browser.

What is a Route?
A route is simply a URL pattern that tells Django:
“When the user visits this path, call this view.”

🛠️ How to Create URLs in Django
🔹 Step 1: In your app’s views.py, create a view
🔹 Step 2: In your app’s urls.py, add a URL pattern
🔹 Step 3: Link the app URLs to the main project

📦 Project & App Setup
Create a new project
django-admin startproject myproject

Create a new app
python manage.py startapp myapp

🚀 Development Server
Run local dev server
python manage.py runserver

• Default port is 8000; to change:
python manage.py runserver 8080

🗄️ Database Migrations
Create new migration files (after you edit models.py)
python manage.py makemigrations

Apply migrations to the database
python manage.py migrate

🔐 Admin & Users
Create a super-user
python manage.py createsuperuser

Change a user’s password
python manage.py changepassword <username>

🐚 Interactive Shell
Open Django shell
python manage.py shell
Open with IPython (if installed)

python manage.py shell_plus

⚙️ Static & Media Files
Collect static files (for production)
python manage.py collectstatic

Clear sessions (delete expired session data)
python manage.py clearsessions
🧪 Testing
Run test suite
python manage.py test

📜 Database Inspection
Show SQL for a migration
python manage.py sqlmigrate <app_label> <migration_number>

Show applied migrations
python manage.py showmigrations

💾 Data Import/Export
Export data to JSON
python manage.py dumpdata <app_label.ModelName> > data.json

Load data from JSON
python manage.py loaddata data.json

❓ Help & Introspection
List all available commands

python manage.py help
Get help on a specific command
python manage.py help migrate
